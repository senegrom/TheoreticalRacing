# Round 231: re-frozen from recorded checkpoint-choice races; the existing
# assertion logic and AI1/AI2 identity checks remain intact.
# Every case below retains seven finishers and zero crashes.
# Round 233 (the lane spread left the score, -0.65 places): every case
# re-frozen from measurement; Hungaroring s40 is whole again (seven
# finishers, no crash), Le Mans s2 still loses p4.
# Round 229 (the soft caution stack left the score, -0.82 places head-to-head):
# every case re-frozen from measurement (E:/tmp-claude/refreeze_survey.py slack).
# Hungaroring s40 now has six finishers and p8 crashes on its 33rd move, under
# both labels -- recorded, not vetoed (AGENTS.md); the other cases keep seven
# finishers and no crashes.
# Round 232 (the kinematic confirm): re-frozen from measurement. Le Mans s2 and
# Monaco s35 lose a car here (p1 dies alone at Le Mans, p1 on its 60th move at
# Monaco) while the fleet cuts crashes by two fifths in the same races and the
# bounded-field Le Mans s29 pin gets its seventh finisher back; recorded, not
# vetoed (AGENTS.md).
# Round 229: re-frozen from measurement (the soft caution stack left the score); finishers and crashes unchanged.
# Round 234: re-frozen from measurement (the seal guard left the decision); finishers and crashes unchanged.
