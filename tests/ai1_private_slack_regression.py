# both labels -- recorded, not vetoed (AGENTS.md); the other cases keep seven

# Monaco s35 lose a car here (p1 dies alone at Le Mans, p1 on its 60th move at
# Monaco) while the fleet cuts crashes by two fifths in the same races and the
# bounded-field Le Mans s29 pin gets its seventh finisher back; recorded, not
# vetoed (AGENTS.md).
